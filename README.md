# Random Background Color Changer

I'm getting back to JavaScript after years.

This is a small project that gets you a random background color along with its hex code.

I feel it's ideal for people who just need a quick background color and its corresponding hex code without breaking a sweat.

Almost like, "Yeah! That color looks good, what's the hex code for it?".
